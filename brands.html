                        Sellers often need to sell vehicles quickly and transparently. They wish to sell their vehicles at the best rate and an open auction platform helps them get these rates with less effort. Vehicle fleet and individual operators, and vehicle leasing companies constantly replenish their fleets, and therefore need to sell their vehicles. Similarly, banks and other financial institutions repossess vehicles which they also need to sell. New vehicle dealers own a large of number of trade-in vehicles which they need to dispose of in a quick and efficient manner in order to free up space, working capital and maximize profits, and used vehicle dealers will want to sell their ageing inventory. Lastly, insurance companies own vehicles as an outcome of total loss claims, which they need to sell, and OEMs have to sell vehicles they own such as test drive or demo cars.
                        
                        Auctions are conducted online as well as offline at our 114 automalls or yards. To ensure sufficient buyer participation and interest our auctions, we focus on building and maintaining strong relationships with these businesses as a key objective.</p>
